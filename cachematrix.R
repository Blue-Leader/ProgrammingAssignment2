## This R file contains functions that will cache an inverse matrix, and solve
## the inverse of the matrix if it is not already cached.

## This function - does something cool here. V1 - setting up the sync file.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
